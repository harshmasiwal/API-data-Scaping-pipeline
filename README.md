# API-data-Scaping-pipelineüìà
**An ETL pipeline leveraging Spotify API data scraping to build a music database with Azure tools for real-time insights.**

# üöÄ Scope:
The project involves the complete process of constructing a music database, beginning with the extraction of artist data from Spotify API. This includes details such as albums, followers, and genres. I developed a functional ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline and enhanced my understanding of Microsoft Azure, which is an important technology in today's data landscape. This task requires the successful implementation and optimization of the data pipeline while incorporating Azure services as necessary. The main goal is to gain practical experience in designing, building, and maintaining an effective data pipeline, which will contribute to my overall proficiency in data engineering and analytics.
